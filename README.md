I’m currently a student at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.notion.so/Read-me-file-33977fdf867441f5b7bb78f9a6e96c8c?pvs=21) where I’ll be studying a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Learn more about my education [here](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science).

This past summer I’ve worked on some [projects](http://farooqqureshi.com/work), read [a lot](farooqqureshi.com/work) and occasionally [written some thoughts](http://fq.bearblog.dev). 

I’m deeply interested in: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and human-robot interaction.
