# Hi, I’m Farooq

## Me in three lines

I’m a (soon to be) student at the [University of Ottawa](HTTP://uottawa.ca) studying a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Learn more about my education [here](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science).

This past summer I’ve worked on some [projects](http://farooqqureshi.com/work), read [a lot](http://farooqqureshi.com/books) and occasionally [written some thoughts](http://fq.bearblog.dev). 

I’m deeply interested in: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and human-robot interaction.
