# Hi, I’m Farooq.

## Me in 3 lines

I’m currently a student at the [University of Ottawa](uottawa.ca) where I’ll be studying a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Learn more about my education [here](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science).

This past summer I’ve worked on some [projects](http://farooqqureshi.com/work), read [a lot](http://farooqqureshi.com/books) and occasionally [written some thoughts](http://fq.bearblog.dev). 

I’m deeply interested in: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and human-robot interaction.
